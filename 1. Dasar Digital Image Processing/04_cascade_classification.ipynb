    "Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their [paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) and improved later by [Rainer Lienhart](http://wiki.opencv.org.cn/images/5/52/MRL-TR-May02-revised-Dec02.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV provides a training method ( see [Cascade Classifier Training](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html)) or pretrained models, that can be read using the cv2.CascadeClassifierload method. The pre-*trained* models are located in the data folder in the OpenCV installation or can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/3.4/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will play with some of the provided pre-trained haarcascades models. More on this topic can be found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html).\n"
